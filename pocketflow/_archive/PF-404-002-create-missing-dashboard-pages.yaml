description: |
  TabNavigation and other UI components reference multiple dashboard routes that
  don't exist yet. When users click these tabs/links, they get 404 errors.

reproduction_steps:
  - Navigate to /dashboard/client
  - Try to navigate to "Calendar" tab → 404
  - Try to navigate to "Messages" tab → 404
  - Try to navigate to "Discover", "Workout", "Progress" → all 404s
  - Click "Settings" button in header → 404
  - Similar issues for trainer role with "Clients", "Programs", etc.

missing_routes:
  - /dashboard/settings
  - /dashboard/calendar
  - /dashboard/messages
  - /dashboard/discover
  - /dashboard/workout
  - /dashboard/progress
  - /dashboard/clients
  - /dashboard/programs
  - /dashboard/community/people
  - /dashboard/community/groups
  - /dashboard/community/events

proposed_fix: |
  Create "under construction" stub pages for all missing dashboard routes.
  Each page should:
  - Work with AppLayout (navigation will render automatically)
  - Show clear "under construction" message
  - Describe what the feature will do
  - Include PocketFlow ticket reference

acceptance_criteria:
  - ✅ All 11 dashboard routes created and accessible
  - ✅ No 404 errors when navigating via TabNavigation
  - ✅ Pages render with AppLayout (full navigation)
  - ✅ "Under construction" messaging is clear
  - ✅ Icons and headings match the feature being built
  - ✅ Client components where needed (use client directive)

files_affected:
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/calendar/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/messages/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/workout/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/progress/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/clients/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/programs/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/community/people/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/community/groups/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/dashboard/community/events/page.tsx (created)

implementation:
  - Created 11 new stub pages under dashboard route group
  - All pages marked as "use client" where needed
  - Consistent design: icon, title, subtitle, under construction card
  - Pages automatically wrapped by dashboard layout (AppLayout)

related_tickets:
  - PF-NAV-001 (navigation now works to reach these pages)
  - PF-FEAT-* (future tickets for actual implementations)

notes: |
  Navigation is now fully functional - all tabs and links work without 404s.
  These are stubs that will be replaced with real implementations in future sprints.
