description: |
  Multiple public-facing pages were linked from the homepage and footer but didn't
  exist, resulting in 404 errors. These pages are referenced but not implemented yet.

reproduction_steps:
  - From homepage, click "Become a Trainer" → 404
  - From homepage, click "Book a Demo" → 404
  - From footer, click "About" → 404
  - From footer, click "Contact" → 404
  - From footer, click "Privacy Policy" → 404
  - From footer, click "Terms of Service" → 404

missing_routes:
  - /become-a-trainer
  - /book
  - /about
  - /contact
  - /privacy
  - /terms

proposed_fix: |
  Create professional "under construction" stub pages for each missing route.
  Each page should include:
  - Clear messaging that the page is under construction
  - Brief description of what will be there
  - Link back to home
  - PocketFlow ticket reference for tracking

acceptance_criteria:
  - ✅ All 6 pages created and accessible
  - ✅ No 404 errors when navigating from homepage/footer
  - ✅ Each page has "under construction" messaging
  - ✅ Each page includes "Back to Home" button
  - ✅ Pages use PublicLayout (header + footer)
  - ✅ Professional design matching site branding
  - ✅ PocketFlow ticket references included

files_affected:
  - apps/web/app/(public)/become-a-trainer/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/(public)/book/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/(public)/about/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/(public)/contact/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/(public)/privacy/page.tsx (created)
  - apps/web/app/(public)/terms/page.tsx (created)

implementation:
  - Created 6 new stub pages in (public) route group
  - Used consistent design: icon, title, description, CTA, ticket ref
  - All pages automatically wrapped by PublicLayout

related_tickets:
  - PF-CONTENT-001 (future: actual content for these pages)

notes: |
  These are temporary stubs. Real content should be added in future sprints.
  For now, users get a professional message instead of 404 errors.
