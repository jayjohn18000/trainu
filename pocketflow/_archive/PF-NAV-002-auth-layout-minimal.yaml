title: Create minimal layout for authentication pages
type: feature
priority: P1
status: completed
created: 2025-10-06

description: |
  Auth pages (/sign-in, /sign-up) had NO layout at all - not even a header or logo.
  Users arriving at these pages had no context about what app they were signing into.

reproduction_steps:
  - Navigate to /sign-in or /sign-up
  - Observe: No header, no logo, no branding, no "back to home" link
  - Page looks incomplete and unprofessional

suspected_cause: |
  The (auth) route group had no layout.tsx file. Auth pages were only wrapped by
  the root layout (which is minimal).

proposed_fix: |
  Create app/(auth)/layout.tsx with:
  - Simple header with TrainU logo
  - "Back to Home" link
  - Centered content area for auth forms
  - Clean, minimal design (don't need full AppLayout navigation)

acceptance_criteria:
  - ✅ Auth pages show TrainU branding in header
  - ✅ "Back to Home" link navigates to /
  - ✅ Logo is clickable and returns to home
  - ✅ Layout is responsive and centered
  - ✅ Maintains minimal design (no full nav needed for auth)

files_affected:
  - apps/web/app/(auth)/layout.tsx (newly created)
  - apps/web/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx
  - apps/web/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx

implementation:
  - Created app/(auth)/layout.tsx with minimal header
  - Used PublicHeader styling as reference
  - Centered main content area for auth forms

notes: |
  Auth pages now have professional branding while keeping the minimal UX appropriate
  for sign-in flows. Users can easily navigate back to home.
