# PR Summary: Restore Global Navigation & Fix All Routes

## Overview

**Type:** fix(navigation) + feat(routes) + chore(analytics)  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Navigation Failure  
**Tickets:** PF-NAV-001, PF-NAV-002, PF-LINKS-001, PF-404-001, PF-404-002, PF-ERROR-001, PF-ANALYTICS-001  

This PR restores navigation across the entire TrainU application and eliminates all 404 errors by creating professional stub pages for missing routes.

---

## Problem Statement

Users were completely unable to navigate the dashboard - the `AppLayout` component existed but was never integrated. Additionally, 17 routes were referenced in the UI but didn't exist, causing 404 errors throughout the app.

### Critical Issues Fixed
1. ✅ Dashboard pages had NO navigation (users stranded)
2. ✅ Auth pages had NO layout or branding
3. ✅ 4/4 homepage links led to 404s
4. ✅ 4/4 footer links led to 404s
5. ✅ 9/9 dashboard tab links led to 404s
6. ✅ Auth route links used wrong format (route group notation)
7. ✅ No branded error pages (404/500)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Restoration
- **Modified:** `apps/web/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
- **What:** Integrated `AppLayout` component (TabNavigation + RoleSwitcher)
- **Impact:** All dashboard pages now have full navigation

### 2. Auth Layout
- **Created:** `apps/web/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
- **What:** Minimal branded layout for sign-in/sign-up pages
- **Impact:** Professional auth experience with "Back to Home" link

### 3. Fixed Broken Links
- **Modified:** `apps/web/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx`
- **What:** Fixed 4 auth links using wrong route group notation
- **Before:** `href="/(auth)/sign-in"`
- **After:** `href="/sign-in"`

### 4. Public Pages (6 created)
- `/become-a-trainer` - Trainer onboarding placeholder
- `/book` - Demo booking placeholder
- `/about` - Company info placeholder
- `/contact` - Contact form placeholder
- `/privacy` - Privacy policy placeholder
- `/terms` - Terms of service placeholder

### 5. Dashboard Pages (11 created)
- `/dashboard/settings` - Account settings
- `/dashboard/calendar` - Calendar view
- `/dashboard/messages` - Messaging system
- `/dashboard/discover` - Discovery feed
- `/dashboard/workout` - Workout library
- `/dashboard/progress` - Progress tracking

- `/dashboard/programs` - Program library
- `/dashboard/community/people` - Community directory
- `/dashboard/community/groups` - Group challenges
- `/dashboard/community/events` - Events/workshops

### 6. Error Boundaries
- **Created:** `apps/web/app/not-found.tsx` - Branded 404 page
- **Created:** `apps/web/app/error.tsx` - Global error boundary

### 7. Analytics Disabled
- **Modified:** `apps/web/lib/posthog.ts` - Disabled PostHog init
- **Modified:** `apps/web/app/providers.tsx` - Updated comments
- **Why:** Per project decision to defer until Phase 3+

### 8. Testing Infrastructure
- **Created:** `apps/web/scripts/audit-routes.ts` - Route scanner
- **Created:** `apps/web/tests/crawl.spec.ts` - Playwright crawler
- **Created:** `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` - Test config
- **Added:** NPM scripts: `audit:routes`, `crawl`, `qa`

## Testing

### Manual Testing
✅ All homepage links navigate successfully  
✅ All footer links navigate successfully  
✅ Dashboard navigation (tabs, back button, settings) works  
✅ Auth pages show branding and "Back to Home"  
✅ Role switching works (client ↔ trainer)  
✅ Mobile navigation functional  
✅ 404 page shows for invalid routes  
✅ Error boundary catches React errors  

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Audit all routes
npm run audit:routes
# Output: 27 routes discovered

# Crawl and screenshot all pages (requires dev server)
npm run crawl
# Output: Report to tmp/crawl-report.json

# Run full QA suite
npm run qa
```

```
Dashboard Route:
├── No navigation
├── No back button
├── User stranded
└── 404 errors everywhere

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This is purely additive and fixes broken functionality.

---

## Migration Notes

**None required.** All changes are backward compatible.

---

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size:** +~15KB (new pages are lazy-loaded)
- **Initial Load:** No change (pages load on-demand)
- **Navigation:** Instant (client-side routing)

---

## Security Considerations

- ✅ RLS policies unchanged (auth still enforced at data layer)
- ✅ Public pages are intentionally public
- ✅ Auth routes don't bypass Supabase auth
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in stubs

---

## Accessibility

- ✅ All new pages have proper heading hierarchy
- ✅ Skip links on dashboard pages
- ✅ Screen reader labels on navigation
- ✅ Keyboard navigation supported
- ✅ ARIA attributes on interactive elements
- ✅ Minimum touch targets (44x44px) met

## Follow-Up Work

These stub pages need real implementations (future PRs):

- [ ] PF-CONTENT-* - Real content for public pages
- [ ] PF-FEAT-* - Real implementations of dashboard features
- [ ] PF-OBS-001 - Re-enable PostHog & Sentry (Phase 3+)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Revert dashboard layout:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Quick fix:** Remove `<AppLayout>` from `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

3. **No data migration needed** - all changes are UI-only

---

## Deployment Notes

- ✅ No environment variables required
- ✅ No database migrations needed
- ✅ No external service changes
- ⚠️  Ensure dev server running before QA tests

---

## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Verify navigation works on all dashboard pages
- [ ] Test role switching (client ↔ trainer ↔ gym_admin)
- [ ] Check mobile navigation (responsive design)
- [ ] Verify all homepage/footer links work
- [ ] Test 404 page (visit invalid route)
- [ ] Test error boundary (force React error)
- [ ] Run `npm run qa` and review report
