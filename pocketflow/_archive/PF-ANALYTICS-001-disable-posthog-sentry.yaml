title: Disable PostHog and Sentry until Phase 3+
type: task
priority: P1
status: completed

description: |
  Per project decision, PostHog (analytics) and Sentry (error tracking) should be
  disabled until core features are stable. The packages are installed but should
  not be initialized or used yet.

reproduction_steps:
  - Check lib/posthog.ts - PostHog initialization code exists
  - Check app/providers.tsx - Analytics providers commented out
  - PostHog events may be called throughout the codebase

proposed_fix: |
  1. Disable PostHog initialization in lib/posthog.ts
  2. Export a no-op proxy to prevent errors in code that imports posthog
  3. Add clear comments explaining they're disabled until Phase 3+
  4. Update providers.tsx with re-enablement instructions
  5. Sentry is already not configured, just ensure it stays that way

acceptance_criteria:
  - ✅ PostHog initialization commented out in lib/posthog.ts
  - ✅ No-op proxy exported to prevent import errors
  - ✅ Clear comments added explaining deferral decision
  - ✅ providers.tsx updated with re-enablement instructions
  - ✅ No runtime errors from disabled analytics
  - ✅ Sentry remains unconfigured (no sentry.*.config.ts files)

files_affected:
  - apps/web/lib/posthog.ts (modified)
  - apps/web/app/providers.tsx (modified)

implementation:
  - Commented out posthog.init() in lib/posthog.ts
  - Created no-op proxy object with stub methods
  - Added detailed comments about Phase 3+ re-enablement
  - Updated providers.tsx with re-enablement checklist
  - Verified Sentry has no initialization code

related_tickets:
  - PF-OBS-001 (future: re-enable analytics and error tracking)

notes: |
  This allows the team to focus on core features first. Analytics and error
  tracking will be enabled once the app is stable and generating real user traffic.
  
  Re-enablement checklist:
  1. Uncomment posthog.init() in lib/posthog.ts
  2. Add PostHogProvider to providers.tsx
  3. Create sentry.client.config.ts and sentry.server.config.ts
  4. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY and SENTRY_DSN in environment
