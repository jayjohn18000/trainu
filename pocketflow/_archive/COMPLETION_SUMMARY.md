7. **PF-ANALYTICS-001** - Disabled PostHog and Sentry until Phase 3+
8. **PF-ERROR-001** - Added root-level error boundaries
9. **PF-NAV-002** - Created minimal layout for authentication pages

### Medium Priority (P2)
10. **PF-404-001** - Created stub pages for missing public routes (6 pages)
11. **PF-DATA-001** - Seeded trainer directory with 15 diverse trainers

## Key Improvements

### Navigation System
- **Full AppLayout** now renders on all dashboard routes with TabNavigation and RoleSwitcher
- **Auth Layout** provides minimal branded experience for sign-in/sign-up
- **Public Layout** (header + footer) wraps all public pages
- **All links fixed** - no more route group notation in hrefs

### Route Coverage
- **17 new stub pages** created to eliminate all 404 errors
- Public: `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/become-a-trainer`, `/book`
- Dashboard: `/settings`, `/calendar`, `/messages`, `/discover`, `/workout`, `/progress`, `/clients`, `/programs`, plus 3 community sub-routes

### Error Handling
- **Root-level error boundaries** provide graceful failure recovery
- **Custom 404 page** with branding and helpful navigation
- **Global error.tsx** with reset functionality and Sentry-ready logging

### Critical Fixes
- Fixed server-side rendering error in TabNavigation (location → pathname)
- Fixed Supabase connection (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL → SUPABASE_URL)
- Fixed all navigation paths to include /dashboard prefix
- Fixed auth links to use proper URLs (not route group notation)

### Data & Content
- **15 diverse trainers** seeded across multiple specialties
- Professional photos from Unsplash
- Realistic ratings, client counts, and session numbers
- Mix of verified and pending verification status

### Technical Decisions
- **PostHog disabled** - deferred to Phase 3+ when core features are stable
- **Sentry not configured** - will add error tracking in future phase
- **No-op proxy** for posthog to prevent import errors

## Notes

This sprint focused on **foundation and navigation** - ensuring users can navigate the app without hitting 404 errors or server crashes. All core navigation systems are now in place and functional.

The app is now in a stable state ready for feature development. Future work can focus on building out the actual functionality behind the stub pages.
