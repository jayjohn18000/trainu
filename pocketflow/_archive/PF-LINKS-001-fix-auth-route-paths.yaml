title: Fix broken auth links in PublicHeader (route group notation)
type: bug
priority: P0
status: completed

description: |
  PublicHeader used incorrect route paths for sign-in and sign-up links. Links were
  using route group notation `/(auth)/sign-in` which is for folder organization only,
  not URLs. This resulted in 404 errors when users clicked these links.

reproduction_steps:
  - Visit homepage or any public page
  - Click "Sign In" or "Get Started" button in header
  - Browser navigates to `/(auth)/sign-in` or `/(auth)/sign-up`
  - Result: 404 Not Found

suspected_cause: |
  Developer misunderstanding of Next.js App Router route groups. The `(auth)` folder
  is a route group for organization - it doesn't appear in the URL path. Correct URLs
  should be `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` (without the `(auth)` prefix).

proposed_fix: |
  Update PublicHeader.tsx to use correct paths:
  - href="/(auth)/sign-in" → href="/sign-in"
  - href="/(auth)/sign-up" → href="/sign-up"
  
  Apply fix in both desktop and mobile navigation sections.

acceptance_criteria:
  - ✅ "Sign In" link navigates to /sign-in successfully
  - ✅ "Get Started" button navigates to /sign-up successfully
  - ✅ Both desktop and mobile navigation fixed
  - ✅ No 404 errors on auth page navigation
  - ✅ Auth pages render with new minimal layout

files_affected:
  - apps/web/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx

implementation:
  - Replaced `/(auth)/sign-in` with `/sign-in` (2 places in desktop nav)
  - Replaced `/(auth)/sign-up` with `/sign-up` (2 places in desktop nav)
  - Applied same fixes to mobile navigation section
  - Total: 4 link updates

notes: |
  This is a common mistake when first learning Next.js App Router route groups.
  Route groups like (auth), (public), (marketing) are organizational only and
  don't affect URL structure.
